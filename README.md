# GeoDEN


**GeoDEN** (Geographic Dengue Exploration) is a visual exploration tool that empowers epidemiologists and researchers to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution, movement, and co-occurrence of dengue virus serotypes (DENV1–DENV4). This repository hosts the code and data used to build GeoDEN, as described in our paper published in _Computer Graphics Forum_.

By combining a map of reports with other visualizations and the power to select a specific place an time, GeoDEN enables the user find novel insights as well as verify known knowlege and events.

**Figure**  
**A.** Serotype Selection: choose active serotypes.  
**B.** Animation Controls: toggle and adjust animation speed.  
**C.** Interval Length Editor: modify number of years visualized.  
**D.** Region Faceting: define regions for visualization.  
**E.** Co-Occurrence Histogram: examine frequency of serotype co-occurrence.  
**F.** Year Editor: adjust the year.  
**G.** Heatmap Timeline: compare regions and serotypes over time.  
**H.** Map: view reports, centroids, trajectories, and environmental suitability.

 - Serotype 1 is Yellow
 - Serotype 2 is Pink
 - Serotype 3 is Blue
 - Serotype 4 is Green

Key features include:
- An **interactive map** that visualizes dengue reports by serotype over time, serotype **clusters** , and **cluster trajectories** . 
- **Timeline heatmaps** and **linked views** for comparing different geographic regions and intervals.  
- **Animation controls** that allow you to watch the progression of dengue reports across years.  
- **Co-occurrence histograms** to investigate which serotypes appear together.  
- **Environmental suitability map** overlay (optional) to see where dengue is expected to occur based on climate and demographic factors.  


## Quick Start

1. **Open the app** in your local browser or online environment.  
2. **Select serotypes** of interest from the control panel.  
3. **Define regions** (or continents, countries) and filter the timeline.
4. **cluster** the serotypes on the map or view trajectories.  
5. **Animate** through the years to see how serotypes spread or overlap.  
6. **Use the co-occurrence histogram** to see which serotypes frequently appear together.  

## Usage

- **Region Faceting**: Click on “Edit Regions” to group countries (or sub-continents) into user-defined regions.  
- **Timeline Heatmap**: Drag on the heatmap to refine the date interval, or use the arrow keys to step forward/back in time.  
- **Animation**: Press play/pause to animate year by year; adjust the speed slider as needed.  
- **Co-Occurrence**: Check the bars to compare frequencies of single or multiple serotypes in the selected region/time range.  
- **Environmental Suitability**: Toggle between a standard basemap and the environmental suitability overlay to see expected vs. reported dengue occurrence.

### Dataset

*GeoDEN* uses [Messina et al. 2014's](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20144) global dataset of reports for the years from 1943 - 2013.

A supplementary dataset has been added to fill in more recent data, and this covers the years 2014 - 2020.

<font size = '1'> *In the future, we would like to fill out our data from 2011 - present.* </font>

*GeoDEN* also uses [Messina et al. 2019's](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0476-8) map of *Aedes* mosquito enironmental suitability, calculated using with data from 2015.
